# kaggle-competition-5-ghosts

a.	What is the overall purpose of this project?: Predict classifications (ghosts, ghouls, and goblins) based on a training dataset.
b.	What do each file in your repository do?: The Ghosts.R file contains my R script for my first submission. The stacked_model.R file contains my Rscript that employs a stacked model. The remainder of the files consist of datasets.  
c.	What methods did you use to clean the data or do feature engineering? I used Pre-processing to create principal components for my stacked model.  
d.	What methods did you use to generate predictions? I used a standard XGBoost model (see Ghosts.R) and a XGBoost stacked model (see stacked_model.R).
